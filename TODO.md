# Tasks

- Refactor the code to use the organism class
- Figure out the best way to force function signatures for each of the class's 
functions
  - For example, we need a way to enforce that the generateOrganism function 
  actually returns an organism
- Implement more crossover algorithms
- Implement mutation in crossover algorithms
- Convert to TypeScript to enforce types
- enforce the assumptions we are already making with assertions and stuff
